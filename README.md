- Checkbox to toggle on/off the option to rename the first vessel too (if the vessel has already an unique name it will add the suffix anyway)

- You can rename the vessel by clicking on the "Rename Now" button from its window, which is activable by clicking on the button on the toolbar.
  - It shows also a preview of the name on the confirm window

- A preset system, where you can store the "name of the vessel" + "suffix" + "numbering style": so you can have all your "vessel group" (like Kerbin' satellites) having the same pattern, with just a click of a button!
